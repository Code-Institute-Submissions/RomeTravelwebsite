The name of the Colosseum derived from the immense statue of Nero-called the colossus after the Colossus of Rhodes- that stood nearby; the entire area was originally within Nero's Domus Aurea, his palace complex in the center of ancient Rome.<span></p>

                                        <p>Rome's Palatine Hill is one of the famous "Seven Hills of Rome"—the hills near the Tiber River <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">where different ancient settlements once developed and gradually joined together to form the city. The Palatine, one of the hills closest to the river, is traditionally regarded as the founding site of Rome. Legend holds that it was here in 753 B.C. that Romulus, after killing his brother, Remus, built a defensive wall, set up a system of government and started the settlement that would grow to become the greatest power of the ancient Western World.  Of course, he named the city after himselfThe Palatine Hill is part of the main archaeological area of ancient Rome and is adjacent to the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Yet many visitors to Rome only see the Colosseum and Forum and skip the Palatine. They are missing out. The Palatine Hill is full of fascinating archaeological ruins, and admission to the hill is included with the combined Forum/Colosseum ticket. It's always far less visited than those other two sites, so can offer a nice respite from the crowds.</span></p>

                                        <p>The church was built in 1137 on the <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">site of another church from the 8th century, which in turn was built on a pagan temple dedicated to the goddess Clementia.
                                        The exterior of the church testifies its construction in two different phases: in the first phase, were built the apsidal area, the northern arm of the transept and the lower part of the southern arm in gray sandstone, with square ashlars, while the remaining parts were built in the second phase, in light ocher sandstone, with rather small ashlars.
                                        With the central apse and the transept built, the high altar was consecrated in 1185, and the presbytery and apses on the east side of the transept were completed in 1187.
                                        Work slowed down during the 13th century due to economic difficulties. However, the blind facade and the atrium were completed. Another porch was added, subsequently demolished for the construction of the Colleoni Chapel.
                                        During the 14th century, the baptistery was built, and between 1436 and 1459, the bell tower was erected by Bertolasio Moroni. The north-west apse was demolished in 1472 by Bartolomeo Colleoni to make room for his chapel. In 1521, the south-west portal, known as Porta della Fontana (Fountain Door), was built by the architect Pietro Isabello.</span></p>

                                        Due to a lack of written records, many unknowns surround the present-day Pantheon, including who designed it and how long its construction took.
                                        The Pantheon’s design has influenced countless buildings throughout history, across Europe and throughout the Americas. Today, the Pantheon continues to function as a church, as well as a major tourist destination.</span></p>

It was the year 79 A.D. The scale of the tragedy was appalling: in what had been one of the most active and splendid Roman centres, life came to a permanent standstill.
                                        The thick layer of volcanic material which submerged it, made up to a large extent of ash and lapilli - non-hard material, unlike that which covered Herculaneum and which solidified into extremely hard stone -has meant that the city has remained intact until the present day, not only as far as its buildings are concerned, but also as regards the contents inside the houses and shops, providing an absolutely fascinating picture of "daily" life.</span></p>

The ‘Spanish’ part of the name refers instead to the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See, which would have been located on Piazza di Spagna (literally ‘Spanish Square’) at the base of the monument.
                                        After they were completed in 1725, the steps quickly gained a reputation for being a prime people-watching spot because they attracted a crowd. And not just any gathering, but a particularly good-looking crowd. Why did such a beautiful bunch congregate here? It's simple really. A high concentration of artists and later photographers, who were themselves drawn to the attractive monument, served as bait for wannabe models. In the mid-20th century, A-listers Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck spurred on a stampede of American travelers to the site, after the steps were used as a backdrop in the 1953 hit rom-com, Roman Holiday.Of course, decades of heavy footfall took their toll on the monument. A huge restoration project in 2015 and 2016 saw the Spanish Steps scrubbed clean and returned to their former splendor. These days, they are looking as spick and span as they ever have.</p>

Standing 26 meters tall, 49 meters wide and intricately decorated in the <span id="dots7">...</span><span id="more7">Baroque style, the Trevi Fountain is an unmissable sight in the city. Built on top of an ancient water source, it has recently gone through an intensive restoration and cleaning by the Fendi luxury fashion house. There’s no better time to visit the Trevi Fountain and learn about its history.
                                The Trevi Fountain is as curious as it is splendid. In spite of its grandeur, it lies sandwiched between small streets, where you barely hear the sound of rushing water before you round the corner and are greeted by this monumental structure. The fountain is located at the junction of three roads and more specifically it is built upon the ‘terminal point’ of the Acqua Vergine, one of Rome’s most important aqueducts that transports drinking water to the Eternal City. Acqua Vergine is the modern aqueduct that evolved from the Aqua Virgo, developed by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 19 BC out of a desire to provide citizens with access to quality public services.</span></p>

With a tiny population <span id="dots8">...</span><span id="more8">of 800 people, and guarded by the world’s smallest army, the city nonetheless welcomes some 5 million visitors a year, including devout pilgrims and curious tourists from around the globe.Since its construction began in the 5th century the city has survived destructive wars as well as several radical re-designs. The city we see today is a mere fraction of the size of the many territories previously controlled by the Catholic Church, the governing body of which is the Holy See. Historically, these Papal States made up a large portion of the central Italian Peninsula, before the unification of Italy in 1871 reduced them to essentially the confines of the Vatican walls. In its modern form the Vatican City State has existed since 1929, when the Kingdom of Italy granted its independence. In this treaty, the Holy See and the Vatican City State were defined as two distinct entities – the former is a legally recognised sovereign entity, the religious organisation, while the latter is the country itself with physical borders and a government.</span></p>
