# Rome Travel Spots

In this project, the aim was to build an interactive front-end site. I feel I have done this by building a site that using a variety of different Javascript/Jquery techniques. Some from the lessons provided but also using new techniques i learnt along the way.
I picked the topic i did, as Rome is a favourite holiday destination of mine and i wanted to incorporate a map section to show where they all were to people who may not have visited this wondrful city. I have added features that respond to the users actions and i feel that they would like them in this site.

## UX
***

Attached below are 2 pictures i took of my early days plans. As you can see i have changed it somewhat since the plan but the basic idea of it was very similar. i wanted to create a new page for every destination but i stumbled across the bootsrap album example and thought that would be perfect to form the site how i wanted.

i wanted to create the site so that its easy to follow for people interetsed in visiting Rome but also give enough information about the place they wanted to see. With the map also being avalable it lets them see how to get to each place.
