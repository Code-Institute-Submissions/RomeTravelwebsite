# Rome Travel Spots

In this project, the aim was to build an interactive front-end site. I feel I have done this by building a site that using a variety of different Javascript/Jquery techniques. Some from the lessons provided but also using new techniques i learnt along the way.
I picked the topic i did, as Rome is a favourite holiday destination of mine and i wanted to incorporate a map section to show where they all were to people who may not have visited this wondrful city. I have added features that respond to the users actions and i feel that they would like them in this site.

## UX
***

Attached below are 2 pictures i took of my early days plans. As you can see i have changed it somewhat since the plan but the basic idea of it was very similar. i wanted to create a new page for every destination but i stumbled across the bootsrap album example and thought that would be perfect to form the site how i wanted.
One of my main aims was to make it simple and easy to follow. I wanted anyone to be able to jump in and work outwhat the website was offering. From your fully fleged web designer wanted to know more to someone who is less say computer savvy and just wanted to learn about the main tourist spots on their next holiday.

i wanted to create the site so that its easy to follow for people interetsed in visiting Rome but also give enough information about the place they wanted to see. With the map also being avalable it lets them see how to get to each place.

## Features
***

There are many yet effective features for this website. I wanted to add features that show my understanding and ability with Javasript. Im pleased with the results from this and hope they're as implemented as well as i think they are.

So I created 3 pages to this site and ill go through them and their features indvidually.

The first page is a simple yet effective cover page. I wanted it to be simple and show a picture of one of Rome's most famous landmarks, The Colosseum. I used the Cover Example from Bootsrap to make the page look crisp and effective. I included 2 simple and easy to follow buttons that takes the user to the next 2 pages on the website.

The second page is the page that im most happy with. I've styled it on the Bootstrap album example layout. I've added 9 drop down coloumns that consist of a picture and a little bit of text about new landmarks. I wanted to keep it all neet and tidy so what i decided to do was add a read more section to each coloumn. This keeps everything ncie and streamlined and looks really neat on the page.
it also like all the other pages it has a really basic and easy to use navigation. Just simple and easy as i didnt want it to be complex and take up to much of the page.

The third page inlcudes a map location of all the landmarks in Rome and also has a very basic and easy to use key. I didnt want to over complicate things but the map being involved gives the user an easy and effective way to find all of these locations, and because its google maps its completly able to use for dricetions etc.


## Technologies Used
***

Here's a short summary of the technoligies i used and what they were used for.

-This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript programming languages

-https://getbootstrap.com/

-This project used the HTML Validator to check all coding 

-https://validator.w3.org/

-This project used w3schools with help with some of the html, css and javasript 

-https://www.w3schools.com/

-This project used wikipedia for all the details about the known holiday destinations

## Testing
***

As i stated in the UX, i wanted to make this website as user friendly as possible and easy for customers to follow. i feel i have done this and made thr site easy to follow and nice to work with.

I created a simple layout for the navigation on the site. i wanted 3 easy, simple headings to the page; Home, Places to go and Map Locations. The navigation is simple to follow. Each heading will take you to the corresponding page. 

I wanted to create a very simple Home page. Just a cover photo of The Colosseum and the little navigation onto the site.

On the Places to go section i created a nice easy to follow ablum page. I used the template from Bootsrap and altered it to fit what i needed. i wanted it to be sleak and neat so i used the found out how to create a read more,less function. This way it keeps all the details neat and tidy from the individual coloumns. i wanted it to look nice and clean and i think this was achieved with this fucntion.

With the final page it was my Map Locations. i created a page that has 9 pins of geographical locations, all of which were matched to the key thats above the map. Its easy to follow and nicely layed out. What it also does as i used google maps you can pin the locations to use as a directional tool from one location to the next. to check for things like walking distances or if you'd need to use a taxi etc.
